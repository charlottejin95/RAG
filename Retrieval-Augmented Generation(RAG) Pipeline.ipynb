Josephs, M.D.\\nCotard’s syndrome, a condition in which the patient denies\\nhis or her own existence or the existence of body parts, is a\\nrare illness that has been reported in association with several\\nneuropsychiatric diagnoses. The majority of published lit-\\nerature on the topic is in the form of case reports, many of\\nwhich are several years old. The authors evaluated associated\\ndiagnoses, neuroimaging, and treatments recorded in pa-\\ntients diagnosed with Cotard’s syndrome at their institution. A\\nsearch of the Mayo Clinic database for patients with mention\\nof signs and symptoms associated with Cotard’s in their re-\\ncords between 1996 and 2016 was conducted. The electronic\\nmedical records of the identiﬁed patients were then reviewed\\nfor evidence of a true diagnosis of Cotard’s. Clinical and\\nneuroimaging data were also recorded for these patients. The\\nsearch identiﬁed 18 patients, 14 of whom had Cotard delu-\\nsions. Two of the 14 were excluded due to them being under\\nage 18. The resulting 12 patients had a median age of 52 years\\n(range: 30 – 85 years). On neuroimaging, four patients\\nexhibited frontal lobe changes, four demonstrated gener-\\nalized volume loss, andﬁve had ischemic changes; seven\\npatients demonstrated right-sided or bilateral hemisphere\\nlesions. Treatments included ECT, pharmacotherapy, be-\\nhavioral therapy, psychotherapy, rehydration, and removal\\nof offending drugs. To conclude, Cotard delusions occur in\\nthe context of a relatively wide spectrum of neurological,\\npsychiatric, and medical disorders and present with various\\nneural changes. Nondominant hemisphere lesions may\\nplay a role in the pathophysiology. A number of effective\\ntreatments are available.\\nJ Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 2018; 30:58–65;\\ndoi: 10.1176/appi.neuropsych.17010018\\nCotard’s syndrome is a rare neuropsychiatric condition that\\nmanifests as nihilistic delusions ranging from denial of the\\nexistence of body parts to negation of self-existence.\\n1\\nThough described initially in 1880, very little is understood\\nabout this disorder, and its inclusion in theDSM-5 as a\\nspeciﬁc listing has been avoided. The current status of\\nCotard’s syndrome is its conceptualization as a manifesta-\\ntion of an underlying disorder. While Cotard’si so f t e nd e -\\nscribed as being a psychiatric syndrome, published studies\\nhave shown a strong correlation between a preexisting\\nneurological disease and the condition.\\n1\\nA variety of associated neurological conditions have been\\ndescribed, including migraines, 2 subdural hemorrhage, 3\\ncerebral atrophy,4 cerebral arterio-venous malformation,5\\nmultiple sclerosis, 6 cerebral infarction, 7 superior sagittal\\nsinus thrombosis, 8 parietal lobe tumor, 9 temporal lobe\\nepilepsy,5 Parkinson’s disease,10 encephalopathy,1 and brain\\ninjury.11 Understanding Cotard’s syndrome and its connec-\\ntion to other neurological conditions is essential to identi-\\nfying appropriate treatment modalities.\\nThe goal of this study thus was to identify patients with\\nCotard’s syndrome seen at our institution within the last two\\ndecades and identify those patients in whom the Cotard’s\\nwas felt to be secondary to another psychiatric or neurologic\\nillness or insult. In doing so, we hoped to describe the as-\\nsociation between Cotard’s and other conditions affecting\\nthe brain in order to better deﬁne possible pathophysiologic\\nmechanisms underlying the syndrome.\\nMETHODS\\nPatients were identi ﬁed by searching the Mayo Clinic\\ncomputerized clinical database (1996–2016) for all individ-\\nuals for whom any of the following terms had been men-\\ntioned in the medical records, with variations:Cotard(’s)\\nsyndrome, delusion(s) of negation, nihilistic delusion(s), walk-\\ning corpse syndrome, delusion(s) of missing organs, denial of\\nexistence, idea(s) of damnation.\\nThe search identiﬁed 18 patients. The medical records of\\nall 18 patients were reviewed in detail to determine whether\\nthere was evidence of Cotard delusions. Inclusion criteria\\nfor Cotard’s syndrome included descriptions of negation of\\nthe existence or belief in the destruction of internal organs,\\ndenial of being alive, or denial of the existence of one’s soul,\\nwith nihilistic delusions being necessary for inclusion. Of the\\n18, three patients were excluded after a review of the med-\\nical records revealed no evidence of Cotard’s. These three\\npatients were captured in the original 18 because of com-\\nments in the medical records, such as“denies Cotard de-\\nlusions.” Two additional patients were excluded, as they\\nwere under the age of 18. One patient was removed because\\nhe showed signs of somatoparaphrenia (limb denial) rather\\n58 neuro.psychiatryonline.org J Neuropsychiatry Clin Neurosci 30:1, Winter 2018\\nCLINICAL AND RESEARCH REPORTS', path=None, url=None, mimetype=None), image_resource=None, audio_resource=None, video_resource=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}'), Document(id_='e3eb0939-100d-41b1-b524-728e0552c3b7', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '2', 'file_name': 'A Neuropsychiatric Analysis of the Cotard Delusion.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/drive/MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/LO-Projects/ML Project/RAG/Reference_files/A Neuropsychiatric Analysis of the Cotard Delusion.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 613934, 'creation_date': '2025-06-15', 'last_modified_date': '2025-06-15'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_separator='\\n', text_resource=MediaResource(embeddings=None, data=None, text='TABLE 1.

Addition-\\nally, we identiﬁed other poten-\\ntial diagnostic associations not\\npreviously reported, including\\ndehydration, steroid psychosis,\\nand supranuclear palsy and/or\\namantadine psychosis. How-\\never, it is important to note that\\nin the patient presenting with\\nCotard delusions in the setting\\nof dehydration-induced psycho-\\nsis, there had been previously\\ndocumented diagnoses of paranoid schizophrenia and delu-\\nsional parasitosis, and a history of opiate and benzodiaze-\\npam addiction. Nevertheless, the patient’s delusions did\\nrespond toﬂuid resuscitation, strengthening the idea of its\\npossible involvement in the pathophysiology.\\nAmantadine has been shown to induce psychosis and\\nmania in the literature, but it has not previously been re-\\nported in those presenting with Cotard delusions.\\n15,16 The\\nsame goes for dehydration-related hyponatremia17 and cor-\\nticosteroid use.18\\nA majority (64%) of the patients presented with right-\\nsided or bilateral changes. This is an important ﬁnding\\nthat adds to the growing literature on delusional mis-\\nidenti ﬁcation syndromes (DMSs), under which some\\nposit that Cotard’s syndrome falls.\\n19 Additionally, studies\\nhave demonstrated trends of increased bilateral cerebral\\natrophy and median frontal lobe atrophy in particular\\nin patients diagnosed with Cotard’s.\\n20 We also found the\\nmost commonly affected region was the frontal lobe\\n(36% bilaterally or right-sided), although other areas were\\ninvolved, as well.

Thus, the effectiveness of do-\\npamine antagonists such as risperidone and quetiapine and\\nselective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as cit-\\nalopram (which also has been shown to decrease dopamine\\nin the brain) in this condition can be readily explained.\\n27 In\\na similar vein, amantadine is a dopamine receptor agonist,\\nwhich could potentially explain the resulting psychosis and\\ndelusions in patient 11.\\nThe general approach for treatment involved treating the\\nunderlying medical or neuropsychiatric illness in all cases.\\nOur study also points to the potential beneﬁt of behavioral\\nand psychotherapy in the treatment of Cotard’s syndrome\\nwhen used in conjunction with pharmacotherapy. The nu-\\nmerous treatment modalities shown to be effective in alle-\\nviating symptoms of Cotard’s syndrome in this study are\\npromising in that they conﬁrm that the delusion is often\\neasily combatable with readily available treatments.\\nLimitations of this study include a relatively small cohort,\\nalthough this is a rare delusion, and incomplete follow-up\\ninformation for some patients. Also, in terms of neuro-\\nimaging, three of the 12 patients did not undergo MRI, which\\nis unfortunately an unavoidable limitation in a retrospective\\nstudy such as this. Therefore, multicenter, prospective,\\nclinico-anatomic, and functional imaging studies are needed\\nto determine the anatomic or network disruption that ac-\\ncounts for this uncommon but interesting delusion.\\nAUTHOR AND ARTICLE INFORMATION\\nFrom the Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Rochester, Minn.
